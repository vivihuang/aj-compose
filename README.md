| Service Name | Internal Port | Outside Port | Repo |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ui` | `80` | `3000` | [aj-ui](https://github.com/vivihuang/aj-ui) |
| `bff` | `8080` | `8089` | [aj-bff](https://github.com/vivihuang/aj-bff) |
| `rasa` | `5005` | `5005` | [aj-rasa](https://github.com/vivihuang/aj-rasa) |
| `actions` | `5055` | `5055` | [aj-rasa-actions](https://github.com/vivihuang/aj-rasa-actions) |

| `backend` | `8080` | `8088` | [aj-backend](https://github.com/vivihuang/aj-backend) |

### Networking between services

`http://${service_name}:{service_internal_port}`

For example, for UI to access BFF, use internal port: `http://bff:8080`;

### Outside docker
Use outside port, e.g. to access BFF via your local Postman or application, use `http://localhost:8089`;
